# A neovim config for a simple IDE

This configuration is inspired and partly copied from Christian Chiarulli's
[Neovim-from-scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch) and
Christian Chiarulli's "Unbreakable neovim config".
It's completly written in lua and requires [neovim](http://neovim.io/)
version >=0.7.0 .
